Problem Definition:
For company which is seeking to hire the best talent in the industry, it is important that it manages its workplace in a way that attracts the best talent. This requires the company to be on its toes to understand the expected requirements from a millennial generation that is highly talented and at the same time has little patience!. One of the best ways for the company to constantly improve and be the best place to work for, is to take the employee reviews seriously.

However, the task is onerous because a lot of these reviews are highly subjective, biased, huge in number etc. All these facts lead to waste of precious energy in making strategic decisions that can help improve the work environment to help attract the best talent.

The goal of this project is to implement an Analytics Engine that can aid companies in analyzing hundred or thousands of reviews that they receive periodically and provide decision support on what process or culture of the company needs to be improved upon, in order to make the company a great place to work.
